*For all cats, big and small, who have ever lived, and will ever live.*

Once upon a time, in a land far from here though closer than you may think, was a little town called Whiskerton. Though little, the town was far from ordinary. For not only was it home to a coterie of curious cats, Whiskerton abided by the laws of quantum physics. This is why its feline residents loved it so dearly. Who wouldn't want to live in a place where feathers spontaneously appeared and disappeared? Or where marbles could be red and blue at the same time? Or where one could not tell with certainty where a rubber mouse would land if one tossed it in the air, only where it probably might but quite likely not end up?

Whiskerton was a town governed by probabilities, monumentally different from its neighbor, Pawville. Pawville with its proud canine inhabitants, where every outcome was easily predicted with certainty. The dogs were thrilled that nothing extraordinary ever happened there. The cats hated it for precisely that reason.

No, Whiskerton was where they belonged, with its impossibilities and improbabilities and counterintuitivities. Oh, and tuna biscuits, of course.
